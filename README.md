## Status: In Process
This project is in active development

## Description

### Summary
This project is for a fictional corporation called Wellness Enterprises that is scouting potential locations for a network of Outpatient Medical Clinics to meet current and future needs of underserved areas of Nashville.

This search is of interest to me for many reasons. I’ve always been fascinated by property development and dreamed of owning lots of land. I like to look at property and think of what I might do with the land if I owned it. I’ve also spent some time working at a company that does business intelligence for the healthcare industry. I was on the design side and responsible for making the data easy to read. It was fascinating to see all that goes into deciding where to put a new hospital or medical practice.

This project will examine publicly available data from Medicare, the CDC, Census Bureau and other sources to determine which communities are underserved, have unmet healthcare needs and what those needs are. The final deliverable will be a Tableau dashboard that allows the user to look at the different variables and how they point to potential new clinic locations.

### Motivation
Everyone needs a place to live and everyone needs healthcare. I live on the northwest side of Nashville, where there is no healthcare. Years ago, there were two hospitals and several doctors’ offices nearby but those have all closed. Now the closest hospital is Nashville General, about 20 min away. 

Nashville's Bordeaux neighborhood has traditionally been one of the less-developed, lower income parts of town but as Nashville expands, development is coming its way. The current widening of Clarksville Highway will bring more traffic and more residents. These new residents will want convenient medical care, neighborhood restaurants and other retail services.

I think there’s a need for an Outpatient Clinic in my neighborhood and in others like it. This project will examine Nashville to discover if my hypothesis is true. 

### Technologies
- Python
- Tableau

## Data Questions
- What areas of the city are underserved by existing heathcare locations?
    - Define “underserved” and determine which communities fit the criteria
- What services are needed in those areas?
    - Look at the CDC and RWJF for info on population’s healthcare needs 

## Data Sources
- Medicare Outpatient Provider Utilization and Payment Data: https://is.gd/4JyPoC 
- USPS ZIP Code Crosswalk files:  https://is.gd/lou2U9
- APC to CPT/HCPCS crosswalk: https://is.gd/VRZsLc 
- Tennessee State Population Projections: https://wonder.cdc.gov/population-projections.html 
- Additional data sources as needed

## Known Issues and Challenges
- Finding the right data will be a challenge. There’s a lot of information out there and I’m not always sure what’s what.
- Asking the best questions will be a challenge. I want to find the story in the data rather than try and prove a preceding conclusion.
- How do I know when I’m done?
- I’ll need to learn some new tools, such as CenPy or CARTOframes : to work with Census units such as Block Groups or Tracts, for more accurate delineation and comparison of areas.
